wquiz - Web Based Quiz Engine
=============================
A Quiz engine written in perl. Users are given a random selection of questions 
taken from a list of questions stored in a database.

Users can then review their answers, and try again using another random set of 
questions.

Questions can be multiple choice, checkbox, text or number based. The text 
allows for regular expression checking of the answer and the number allows for 
numerical ranges.

The quiz is administered through a web front end, and can be incorporated into 
an existing web site design using html templates.

A offline feature (which can be disabled), allows the users to print off a list 
of questions which can be completed offline or shared with friends.
